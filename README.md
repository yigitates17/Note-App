# Note-App
I used Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap and Object Relational Mapping (ORM) feature of SQLAlchemy in this project. 

# SIGN UP/LOGIN
To get started, user needs to create and account and be older than 15 years old. After signing up, the user will be logged in automatically.
Users don't have to be logged in to view the notes that already exists.

# HOME PAGE
Home page contains all notes that has been created by every user. User can delete notes on the homepage if the note belongs to the user.
